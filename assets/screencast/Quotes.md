# Marshall McLuhan

Once we have surrendered our senses and nervous systems to the private manipulation of
those who would try to benefit from taking a lease on our eyes and ears and nerves, we
don't really have any rights left. Leasing our eyes and ears and nerves to commercial
interests is like handing over the common speech to a private corporation, or like
giving the earth's atmosphere to a company as a monopoly.
